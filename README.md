# Goss Packer Provisioner

Wouldn't it be nice if you could run [goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) tests against an image during a packer build?

Well, I thought it would, so now you can!  

This runs during the provisioning process since the machine being provisioned is only available at that time.

There is an example packer build with goss tests in the `example/` directory.

## Configuration

```json
"provisioners" : [
  {
    "type": "goss",
    "tests": [
      "goss/goss.yaml"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Additional (optional) properties

```json
"provisioners" : [
  {
    # Packer Args
    "type": "goss",

    # Packer Provisioner Args
    "arch": "amd64",
    "download_path": "/tmp/goss-VERSION-linux-ARCH",
    "inspect": "{{user `inspect_mode`}}",
    "password": "",
    "skip_install": false,
    "url":"https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/releases/download/vVERSION/goss-linux-ARCH",
    "username": "",
    "version": "0.3.2",

    # GOSS Args
    "tests": [
      "goss/goss.yaml"
    ],
    "remote_folder": "/tmp",
    "remote_path": "/tmp/goss",
    "skip_ssl": false,
    "use_sudo": false,
    "format": "",
    "goss_file": "",
    "vars_file": "",
    "target_os": "Linux",
    "vars_env": {
      "ARCH": "amd64",
      "PROVIDER": "{{user `cloud-provider`}}"
    },
    "vars_inline": {
      "OS": "centos",
      "version": "{{user `version`}}"
    },
    "retry_timeout": "0s",
    "sleep": "1s"
  }
]
```

## Spec files
Goss spec file and debug spec file (`goss render -d`) are downloaded to `/tmp` folder on local machine from the remote VM. These files are exact specs GOSS validated on the VM. The downloaded GOSS spec can be used to validate any other VM image for equivalency.  

## Windows support

This now has support for Windows. Set the optional parameter `target_os` to `Windows`. Currently, the `vars_env` parameter must include `GOSS_USE_ALPHA=1` as specified in [goss's feature parity document](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/blob/master/docs/platform-feature-parity.md#platform-feature-parity).  In the future when goss come of of alpha for Windows this parameter will not be required.

## Installation

1. Download the most recent release for your platform from [here.](https://github.com/YaleUniversity/packer-provisioner-goss/releases).

2. Rename the binary to `packer-provisioner-goss`

3. Place the file in one of the directories where packer looks for plugins:

> Once the plugin is named properly, Packer automatically discovers plugins in the following directories in the given order. If a conflicting plugin is found later, it will take precedence over one found earlier.
>
> The directory where packer is, or the executable directory.
>
> ~/.packer.d/plugins on Unix systems or %APPDATA%/packer.d/plugins on Windows.
>
> The current working directory.

4. Set binary to be executable `chmod +x packer-provisioner-goss`

## Build

### Using Golang docker image

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/usr/src/packer-provisioner-goss -w /usr/src/packer-provisioner-goss -e 'VERSION=v1.0.0' golang:1.13 bash
go test ./...
for GOOS in darwin linux windows; do
  for GOARCH in 386 amd64; do
    export GOOS GOARCH
      go get -v ./...
      go build -v -o packer-provisioner-goss-${VERSION}-$GOOS-$GOARCH
  done
done
```
